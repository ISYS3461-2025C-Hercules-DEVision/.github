DEVision is a two-subsystem platform that bridges Job Applicants and Job Managers in a transparent, secure, and scalable way.
Job Applicant Subsystem: Enables users to register, manage profiles, search and apply for jobs, and subscribe for real-time notifications.
Job Manager Subsystem: Allows companies to create job posts, manage applications, search for applicants, and receive notifications for matching candidates.
The system follows a microservice architecture using Spring Boot for the backend, a componentized React frontend, and asynchronous communication through Kafka.
All services are containerized with Docker and can be orchestrated using Kubernetes for scalability and resilience.
